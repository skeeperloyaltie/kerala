7. Also, we wanted to see, who cancelled/rescheduled the appointment. --NEW
9. Also, in the total patients , receptionist  can able to select multiple  and she can able to "reschedule/cancel" at once.. - Its available only to the admin now.. but needed for everyone.. 
11. I want filter button to find a patient uniquely based on the above mentioned options.
14. When adding a patient appointment, we should have “byWhom” and “atWhatTime” it was added. Example : PatientID 101 , “Added By Doctor”, “DOCID1011”, “31-01-2024 22:15”. 
15. There should be a dedicated  page will help doctor/receptionist to see the entire previous/current/upcoming appointments.
        For Receptionist - They can see appointments details (all relevant to the receptionist)
        For Doctor - appointment details, prescribtions, diagnostics details.. (all data relevant to that doctor)
